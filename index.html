                    Statement:
                    The knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a 
                    weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or 
                    equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

                    Every day, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.
                     Return the minimum number of days that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1.

                <p>
                    longest increasing subsequence problem is to find a subsequence of a given sequence in which the subsequence's
                     elements are in sorted order, lowest to highest, and in which the subsequence is as long as possible.

                <p>
                    You are given an array of coins with varying denominations and an integer sum representing the total amount of money;
                     you must return the fewest coins required to make up that sum; if that sum cannot be constructed, return -1.
